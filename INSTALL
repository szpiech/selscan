Pre-compiled binaries for OSX, Linux, and Windows can be found in

bin/osx/
bin/linux/
bin/win/

To install the binaries, just place them somewhere in your $PATH (i.e. ~/bin/).

selscan depends on the C++ standard thread library, which should be available by default
in any build environment on a OSX/Linux system. On Windows, we successfully built selscan using the clang++ compiler with MinGW in an MSYS2 environment. MinGW provides a lightweight development setup for native Windows compilation, while MSYS2 offers Unix-like libraries and utilities. clang++ was used instead of gcc to ensure correct support for C++ standard threads.

selscan (2.1.0+) also depends on zlib (http://www.zlib.net/), which should be
available by default in OSX/Linux build environments.  On Windows, we have had
success compiling zlib in a MinGW environment (http://www.mingw.org/).  A compiled version of zlib in provided in lib/win32/.

To build (some lines in the Makefile may need to be commented/uncommented):

make selscan 

The selscan binary will appear in the src/ directory when built.

The program norm depends on GNU GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). There shouldn't be 
a strict need to download and install these yourself, as pre-compiled static 
versions of GSL for OSX, Linux, and Windows in lib/osx/, lib/linux/, and lib/win32/ are provided.

To build (some lines in the Makefile may need to be commented/uncommented):

make norm 

The norm binary will appear in the src/ directory when built.
